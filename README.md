# Introduction

This is a project by Alexander Reimer and Matteo Friedrich.

We are trying to create an open-source interface for recognizing ERPs of the human brain,
for usage in brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCIs). It is being developed with  simplicity and
ease of use in mind.

We hope to make peoples lives easier and give beginners like ourselves a better chance to
develop their own BCIs.

We're just at the beginnings ourselves, however, and also want to learn and grow through
this project. Any help and advice is appreciated!

See the [documentation](https://AR102.github.io/Interpreting-EEG-with-AI/) for installation
and usage instructions.

See the [paper branch](https://github.com/AR102/Interpreting-EEG-with-AI/tree/refactor) for
(German) papers describing this project and our journey.
