# Introduction

This is a project by Alexander Reimer and Matteo Friedrich.

We are trying to create an open-source interface for recognizing ERPs of the human brain, for usage in brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCIs). It is being developed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.

We hope to make peoples lives easier and give beginners like ourselves a better chance to develop their own BCIs.

We're just at the beginnings ourselves, however, and also want to learn and grow through this project. Any help and advice is appreciated!
